Water


This package includes the following:
- A water shader in graph and text (both depend on shadergraph)
- A particle system using the new visual effects particle systems
- scripts to control splashing
- scripts to control water

You need to hook up your own normal maps to the shaders,
two for an Ocean Shader
and 1 running water for the river shader

the running water normals can be rotated such that they
point the direction that the water is flowing with the
parameter in the shader.

Normal maps can be found on the web in a variety of places,
I recommend:

Good Luck!
